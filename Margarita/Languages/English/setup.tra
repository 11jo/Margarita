@55   = ~This mod need BG1, BGEE, BGT or EET~
@56   = ~Margarita~
@57   = ~When asked about her past, MARGARITA becomes defensive and fidgety. She mentions nameless people and countless places that seem to make her either older than she seems or somewhat loony. The Halfling does seem to mention one thing consistently, and that would be her trade as a courier. You find that after some more prodding, Margarita is constantly trying to shift the subject to something more neutral; implyng that something horrific may have happened in her past, or she's deliberately hiding something from you.~
@58   = ~Bring me Margarita, the halfling stalker.~
